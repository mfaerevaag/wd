.SH NAME
wd \- Quickly warp to custom directories in zsh
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
wd [\fICOMMAND\fP] [\fINAME\fP]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwd\fP (warp directory) lets you quickly jump to custom directories in zsh, without using \fBcd\fP. Why? Because \fBcd\fP is slow for paths that are visited frequently or has a long path.
.
.
